* **Numerical Reasoning Test**: This test assesses a candidate's ability to work with numbers, interpret data from charts and graphs, and solve mathematical problems.
* **Verbal Reasoning Test**: This test evaluates a candidate's language and comprehension skills, including their ability to understand written information and draw logical conclusions.
* **Logical Reasoning Test**: This test measures a candidate's ability to analyze patterns, identify relationships, and draw logical inferences.
* **Abstract Reasoning Test**: Also known as inductive or non-verbal reasoning tests, this assessment evaluates a candidate's ability to identify patterns and relationships in abstract shapes or symbols.
* **Spatial Reasoning Test**: This test assesses a candidate's ability to mentally manipulate shapes and visualize objects in different orientations.
* **Mechanical Reasoning Test**: This test is used for technical or engineering roles and evaluates a candidate's understanding of mechanical concepts and principles.
* **Learning agility** : This type of cognitive ability test is not focused on job performance.Instead, it tests the candidate’s cognitive ability to learn on the job. In other words, how quickly they can soak up the information from a fast-paced job and learn new skills.
* **Perceptual speed and Accuracy** : This test looks at a candidate’s ability to comprehend, process, analyse, and rearticulate information. It measures how quickly an individual is able to process new work and deliver a task in a set amount of time.

# Providers:

There are numerous publishers who administer cognitive ability tests. If you can find out which organisation is publishing the test you’re taking, it means you can prepare using past tests from that publisher, and get used to the specific style and format of questions.
Here are a few of the most popular publishers used in the UK:

* Revelian — An Australian test provider that uses tests created by psychologists for employers across the world.
* SHL — One of the biggest test providers, offering assessments for 150 countries in 30 different languages.
* Predictive Index — A popular pre-employment assessment provider that specialises in cognitive and behavioural tests.

# Some handy Tips:

1. **Understand the Test Format:** Familiarize yourself with the test format and the types of questions you are likely to encounter. There are various aptitude tests, such as numerical, verbal, abstract reasoning, and logical reasoning. Knowing the structure of the test will help you focus your preparation effectively.
2. **Practice Sample Questions:** Many online resources offer sample aptitude test questions. Practice regularly to build familiarity with the question types and improve your speed and accuracy. Work on a wide range of questions to cover various difficulty levels.
3. **Time Management:** Aptitude tests are often timed, so practice answering questions within the given time constraints. Learn to manage your time efficiently to complete as many questions as possible within the allocated time. Don't linger on one problem too long. Skip it or choose an approximate answer and move on.
4. **Brush Up on Basic Skills:** Review basic math concepts (for numerical tests), grammar and vocabulary (for verbal tests), and logical reasoning principles. Strengthening your foundation in these areas will boost your performance in the test.
5. If there's no negative markings, try to attempt all questions.
6. Try to do most of the math in your head.
7. When solving abstract/logical reasoning problems, look for repetitive patterns, symmetry and a flow of movement among the objects.Figure out the answer in your head firt, then look at the options.
8. When solving analogy questions (e.g., 'trees to leaves are as __ to __'), look for functionality between the objects.
9. While solving for comprehension questions, don't read the entire passage, read the questions first and look for keywords in the passage and figure out the answer.
10. Try not to make any assumptions while solving comprehension questions, stick to the information provided in the passage.
11. Answer the easy questions first.
12. Practice, practice, practice !
